Two new files are introduced in this chapter and three existing files are updated:

Web Server Code Unique to this Chapter
......................................

 - **hlcClient.js**
   This file is update to support the shipper interface on the server side

Defining the business network
......................................

 
 - **network/permissions.acl**
   This file is ***updated*** to allow the shipper to access Orders and to execute selected transactions. 
   It determines precisely what transactions a member can execute and what assets a member can see. The basic rule is "If authority is not specifically granted in this file, then access is denied."

Web Browser Code Unique to this Chapter
.......................................

 - **z2b-shipper.js**
   This file contains all of the browser functional code to support the shipper user experience
 - **shipper.html**
   This contains the HTML framework for the provider experience. Content for this framework is generated by the functions in the z2b-shipper.js file
   Text on this page is determined by the selected language (default is US English) 
 - **pageStyles.css**
   This file is updated to support the accordian action on the Finance Company page
