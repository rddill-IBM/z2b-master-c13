Four new files are introduced in this chapter and one existing file is updated:

Web Server Code Unique to this Chapter
......................................
 - **hlcClient.js**
   This contains all code to support the buyer interface on the server side

Defining the business network
.............................
 
 - **network/permissions.acl**
   This file is ***updated*** to allow the buyer to access Orders and to execute selected transactions. 
   It determines precisely what transactions a member can execute and what assets a member can see. The basic rule is "If authority is not specifically granted in this file, then access is denied."
