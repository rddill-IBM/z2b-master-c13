Chapter 2: What's the Story we'll implement?
============================================

Introduction
............

 - Dispute resolution requires gathering and correlating facts from multiple parties. This is a slow and labor intensive effort, which ties up over $100M at any point in time. 
 - In this example, those parties are: 
   - The Finance Organization
   - The Buyer
   - The Seller
   - The Provider
   - The Shipper

The Basic Stories
.................

 - As a Finance Organization, I want to see the finance related status of every order executed by my clients when they are using my credit services instantly and in real-time
 - This will allow me to manage dispute resolution over the phone immediately rather than taking multiple weeks to resolve a dispute. 
 - As a seller, I want to see the order, shipping and finance status of every sale in the system.
 - As a buyer, I want to see the real-time status of every order. 
 - As a buyer, I want to be able to initiate a dispute with the click of a single button and provide all required data automatically to my finance organization
 - As a manufacturer, I want to be able to see all open orders and the shipment status on all orders.
 - As a shipper, I want to be able to interact with this system with as little change as possible on my end.
